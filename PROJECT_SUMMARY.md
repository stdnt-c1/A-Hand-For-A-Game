# AzimuthControl Project Summary

## Project Overview
AzimuthControl is a hand gesture recognition system for HandsFree-Gaming, enabling users to control applications through hand gestures captured via camera. The system uses MediaPipe for hand tracking and provides a modular architecture for different types of controls.

## Major Changes Completed

### 1. Project Reorganization
- **Modular Structure**: Moved from flat file organization to proper module hierarchy:
  - `src/core/`: Core gesture recognition functionality
  - `src/utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
  - `src/performance/`: Performance optimization and C++ extensions
  - `src/controls/`: Control modules for different control types
  - `config/`: Centralized configuration files
  - `tests/`: All test files and test frameworks

### 2. Performance Optimization
- **C++ Extensions**: Successfully compiled `res_balancer.dll` for critical geometric calculations
- **64-bit Support**: Fixed architecture mismatch by installing MinGW-w64
- **Performance Pipeline**: Implemented optimized gesture validation with batch processing
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Added graceful Python fallback when C++ extensions unavailable

### 3. Code Quality
- **Import Fixes**: Updated all import paths to reflect new module structure
- **Error Handling**: Added robust error handling throughout the codebase
- **Documentation**: Added inline documentation and README files
- **Configuration**: Centralized configuration management

### 4. Documentation
- Added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for community contribution standards
- Added `SECURITY.md` with vulnerability reporting process
- Adopted GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)
- Enhanced `README.md` with better installation and usage instructions

### 5. Testing
- Organized all test files into dedicated `tests/` directory
- Created test script for C++ extension validation
- Added performance testing framework

## Technical Details

### C++ Extension Integration
The project now successfully uses C++ extensions for performance-critical operations:
- **Geometric Calculations**: Distance, ROI overlap, bounding box checks
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple points processed in single C++ calls
- **Architecture**: 64-bit DLL compatible with Python 3.11 environment

### Configuration System
- JSON-based configuration files
- Dynamic loading via ConfigManager
- Support for environment-specific overrides
- Validation of configuration structure

## Next Steps
1. Complete comprehensive testing
2. Fine-tune gesture recognition accuracy
3. Optimize for different hardware configurations
4. Create proper release with versioning
