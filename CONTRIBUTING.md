## Project Scope and Limitations

### Author-Specific Calibration

> [!CAUTION]
> This system is specifically calibrated for the original author's hardware configuration and hand anatomy. Modifications may significantly impact performance and accuracy.

### Research Focus

The project prioritizes:
- **Single-hand gesture recognition**
- **Windows gaming integration**
- **Real-time performance optimization**
- **Personal accessibility solutions**

### Technical Constraints

Current limitations include:
- Right-hand detection only
- Windows 11/12 optimization
- Author-specific gesture definitions
- Hardware-dependent performance characteristics

## Future Collaboration

### Potential Changes

While direct contributions are not currently accepted, this policy may evolve as the project develops:

- **Open source transition**: Future consideration for community contributions
- **Academic partnerships**: Potential research collaborations
- **Documentation expansion**: Community-driven documentation improvements
- **Testing initiatives**: Multi-user testing and calibration studies
