% IMPORTANT USAGE NOTES FOR RESEARCHERS:
%
% WARNING: This is a PERSONAL RESEARCH PROJECT with significant limitations:
% - Author-specific calibrations (not generalizable)
% - Non-production prototype (not validated)
% - Individual exploration project (not institutional research)
% - Hardware-dependent performance (Windows 11/12 specific)
% - Right-hand detection only (limited scope)
%
% ETHICAL CITATION GUIDELINES:
% - Always mention the personal/non-production nature
% - Do not present as validated accessibility solution
% - Acknowledge author-specific limitations
% - Emphasize proof-of-concept status
% - Include appropriate disclaimers about generalizability
%
% RECOMMENDED CITATION CONTEXT:
% "Maulida (2025) presents a personal research exploration into gesture-based 
% gaming controls, noting significant limitations including author-specific 
% calibrations and non-production status..."
%
% INAPPROPRIATE USAGE:
% - Do not cite as production-ready accessibility technology
% - Do not reference without mentioning personal research nature
% - Do not use as basis for commercial product claims
% - Do not present as peer-reviewed or validated research
